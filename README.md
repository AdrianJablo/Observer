# Observer
Console application that uses observer:
- Prints “hello world” (or any other text) in the console.
- Watches the mouse movement: 
When the cursor moves to the console window area, the text color in the console changes and the current time is written into the log file with the tag “Enter”.
When the cursor leaves the console window area, the text color changes to the original and the current time is written into the log file with the tag “Leave”.

The code has:
1.	Smart pointers for memory management. Self-written guards or stl/boost solutions for other resources.
2.	stl/boost containers: vector/map/list, etc.
3.	Provides exceptions error handling with strong safety guarantee and best practices.
